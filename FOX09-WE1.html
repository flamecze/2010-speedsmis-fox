           FOX series final round was run at Westhill circuit, a quite fast sweeping up-and down
		   track, which's first half can be run all full throttle in final gear with the FOX cars.
		   Places for attacking thus rather would have to be found in second half, on approach or in final
		   turn and turn 7/8 combination. <p>

		   Series standings' top 4 drivers all placed their cars on first 4 positions on the grid after
		   Qualifying, with only MaukaZ and Adin having switched positions to standings order. Flame lined
		   up 5th, APR drivers Fast Jarda and Gepas started from 6th and 8th, with
		   Y.Laprevotte's teammate Chebbi in between. Bmxtwins again proved to have increased speed
		   and started from 9th position, in front of EAR's T.Daams and KRT's Masato. Zombie, Chris Koot,
		   Speedsims drivers Cholerix and DaveO, along with BS Racing drivers C. and K.Sheppard and
		   all 1LM team made up 2nd half of the grid   </p><p>
              </p><center><img src="./FOX09-WE1_files/FOX_WE1_1.jpg"></center><p>

		   Pole sitter and series' leader Alain Lang came perfectly away from starting line, leading the
		   crowd into first turns, with Y.Laprevotte close behind. Adin soon lost his 3rd position to
		   MaukaZ in first lap's traffic, just as Chebbi dropped behind Gepas and Bmxtwins had to give
		   in to T.Daams. Cholerix and Chris Koot both ran wide in T4 on their own doing and were lucky to be
		   able to crawl back out of the sand, though now way off the field. </p><p>

		   Starting at chicane on the same lap, Chebbi, T.Daams and Bmxtwins were struggling for 9th position,
		   T.Daams trying to pass Chebbi on straight. That fight ended up with Chebbi
		   getting turned around in T7 in front of Bmxtwins, resulting in a major crash and Chebbi
		   limping towards pitlane for repair. Some of the backstarters were well benefiting from
		   that incident when the cars in front had to slow down to avoid getting damaged. DaveO and
		   DanB had started from last row and now were already running on 12th and 14th position </p><p>
              </p><center><img src="./FOX09-WE1_files/FOX_WE1_2.jpg"></center><p>

		   At the end of lap one, KRT drivers Zombie and Masato went in for regular pitstop, following
		   their usual strategy, just like C.Sheppard and Cholerix too, the latter one driven by need after noticing
		   to have forgotten to take up fuel after Qualifying... Chebbi went to pits for repair, while
		   Bmxtwins, Mustangman and MaukaZ had each to perform Drive-Thru penalties. So again after lap
		   one the field was split and only cars in first half still close to each others	</p><p>

		   While Alain Lang was slowly pulling away from all the rest, Y.Laprevotte couldn't shake off
		   those behind. Adin, back on 3, could follow at same speed, just like Fast Jarda, Gepas and Flame.
		   T.Daams was 3 secs off from lap one incident, and another 3 secs ahead of those behind him, led by
		   K.Sheppard, for the same reason. The #07's driver soon was under attack from DaveO and being passed
		   in final turn... only to have DanB show up behind on the next instant - and again being passed
		   at the same place at the end of 3rd lap. </p><p>
              </p><center><img src="./FOX09-WE1_files/FOX_WE1_3.jpg"></center><p>

		   Short time earlier Flame and Gepas had been fighting on approaching T1, with Flame trying to pass on
		   the inside line. That had ended up with both cars colliding on the turn's apex and Gepas flying off
		   towards railings. He was next in need to limp to pits for repair, but definitely not the last one,
		   as there was still 15 laps to perform stunts and incidents... Up to that time Mustangman had
		   been close chasing his bother's car - until he slipped in T7 and
		   performed a 360° spin, which made him drop back. Some laps later on Bmxtwins was much less lucky when
		   he hammered his car into the chicane's tire wall... just like Chris and C.Sheppard had already done
		   before. Unlike the TAG driver, Bmxtwins and C.Sheppard could race on  </p><p>

		   Lap 6 saw some action on several positions. Flame had finally managed to close in to Fast Jarda,
		   which caused that one to push harder... and a little too much in T7/8, causing him to run wide and enable
		   Flame to easily advance to 5th position. Right behind and a little later, DaveO exited final turn
		   on a line superior to T.Daams' and outran the #982 on the straight. Another short time later K.Sheppard
		   was under attack from DanB again, after that one had slipped in lap 4, and again the BSR driver had to
		   give in in final turn. Though not without trying to counterattack on straight and in T1, only without success.</p><p>
              </p><center><img src="./FOX09-WE1_files/FOX_WE1_4.jpg"></center><p>

		   In laps 8 to 10 most drivers were entering pits for regular service; Alain Lang and Y.Laprevotte were
		   on a different schedule and just ran on for now. Most of the early pit visitors advanced some
		   positions, and some, like Chebbi and Masato were getting within reach of top ten again. In lap 11
		   DaveO, with T.Daams still clinging to his car's rear, closed in on Fast Jarda, aiming for 4th
		   position. The #982 was next one to slip in T7/8, spun, and headed for pits next, just like Fast Jarda
		   and K.Sheppard too. On exiting pits T.Daams immediatly was under attack from MaukaZ until that one
		   went into pitlane on the next lap too.	 </p><p>

		   At the end of lap 12 Adin and DaveO were next to enter pits. DaveO had slipped in final turn on approaching
		   pitlane and only came back to the track several positions down, several seconds behind T.Daams. By
		   trying to work off his slip ASAP, DaveO went into chicane way to optimistically in lap 13, thoroughly
		   hit the tire wall and flipped his car. Race over... just like for Gepas too, who never really had
		   recovered from 3rd lap's incident.  </p><p>
              </p><center><img src="./FOX09-WE1_files/FOX_WE1_5.jpg"></center><p>

		   After almost everybody - but the race leader - had been in pits for service, the fight for last podium
		   position became thrilling again. Alain Lang and Y.Laprevotte were running on safe podium positions, but
		   3rd place had to be fought out on final laps. Adin was under attack from Flame, but was next to slip in
		   infamous T7/8 - which had become a popular place to do so. And again unfortunatly the spinning car did
		   so right in front of the approaching pursuer, who had no way to avoid hitting it and sustain
		   serious damage. Just like Chebbi in lap 1, Flame had to limp back to pitlane for repair, while
		   Adin could run on, having recovered just in time in front of Fast Jarda, MaukaZ and DanB. Which all now ran
		   within the same sec.	       </p><p>

		   In lap 16 both Fast Jarda and MaukaZ managed to pass Adin. When all 4 cars entered final turn that lap,
		   DanB got a better line than Adin and it looked like that one would drop from 3 to 6 within same lap -
		   until DanB's exit of that turn led him into Adin's line and caused both cars' tires to contact. While
		   Adin again was the lucky one and could run on without problems, DanB performed a 360° and dropped back, but
		   still ran on a safe 6th place, as T.Daams on 7th position was way back.	</p><p>
              </p><center><img src="./FOX09-WE1_files/FOX_WE1_6.jpg"></center><p>

		   Some more way back, Masato was aiming for 8th position - and K.Sheppard was the obstacle on the way to get it.
		   In lap 14 Masato had closed in on the #07 and started attacking... and was successful in lap 16 in final turn.
		   That place for sure was K.Sheppard's bane this race. Even more way back, after having lost 11th position to
		   Chebbi, Zombie was in danger to get caught up by Cholerix on final lap, as the #12 came closer fast. K.Sheppard
		   was soon facing a similar problem about Chebbi	    </p><p>

		   MaukaZ was back on 3rd position when Fast Jarda ran wide in - surprise - T7/8. Now the series' top 3 drivers
		   were running top 3 positions in the race, with only one lap to go. And with them only being 1 point apart
		   from each others, this was looking to be the final standings as well. At the same time up front Alain Lang crossed
		   the finishing line after having run another flawless race, getting not just the race's, but the series' win
		   as well, there was still action on the back row. </p><p>
              </p><center><img src="./FOX09-WE1_files/FOX_WE1_7.jpg"></center><p>

		   Chebbi gave in to his nerves in T4 and ran wide, handing
		   over 12th position to Cholerix. K.Sheppard even lost 10th position only on approaching
		   the finishing line to Chebbi when that one came out of final turn at superior speed after having closed
		   the gap on the #07 within 2 laps. Y.Laprevotte and MaukaZ finished 2rd and 3rd place in race and standings.
		   Race's 4th was fast Jarda, Adin came in 5th, DanB 6th, T.Daams 7th, Masato 8th and Flame 9th.
